# How to use Terrain Programming

When you're planning for an event, the Unit Council will set up a calendar entry on Terrain's Programming page and assign it to you - this will show below the calendar with an "Edit" button so you can fill out the details. Keep in mind that if the event requires an Operoo form, this is where information for that will mostly be retrieved from; the Jandi reminder that is sent out is also based on this information. It's the central place to plan for Scouts.

## For event organisers

### Find your event
- Make sure you're logged into [Scouts \| Terrain](https://terrain.scouts.com.au/)
- Go to the [Programming page](https://terrain.scouts.com.au/programming)
- Below the calendar, there should be a section titled "Assigned Activities". Click "Edit Plan" on the right of your activity.

### Fill out the plan

**1. Activity Details**

- Give the activity a name, if it doesn't have one already. This is important.
- Give the activity a *short* description. This is also very important.
- The "Why this activity?" field is optional.
- You can only tick one Challenge Area, so consider it carefully. Remember, this is what the activity contributes to in people's Milestones.
- Fill out the time and place carefully and accurately.
- Tick whichever elements of the Scout Method you believe are covered. This is not highly important.
- Click "Next Step".

**2. Participants & Schedules**

- Under "Who is this activity for?", select Unit.
- You should already be the Organiser, so do not remove yourself. If somebody else needs access to edit the event on Terrain, you can add them there.
- You should be also put as the leader for the activity. This field identifies who is attributed the Lead towards their Milestones.
- Any assistants should be in the corresponding field below also. This attributes the Assist to their Milestones.
- You can skip the "Schedules" section. It is different from the main time and location part. The Unit Council will let you know if you should use this function.
- You can put any equipment or supporting notes in the optional fields. This is not required but encouraged for more complicated activities.
- If you need a risk assessment, or have any other planning documents, upload them below in the "Upload Supporting Files" field. For events requiring an Operoo form, ensure you have all the details that parents will need in a document uploaded here.
- Click "Next Step".

**3. Achievement Pathways**

- This page is for the Unit Council, so just scroll to the bottom and click "Next Step".

**4. Attendance**

- This page is to be filled out after concluding the activity, at the direction of the Unit Council. Just scroll to the bottom and click "View Summary".

**Activity Plan Summary**

- Read over the information and ensure it's all filled out and correct. You can come back and edit this plan anytime until the Unit Council requires it to be complete.
- Scroll to the bottom and click "Save".

## For Unit Council

### Set up an event for an organiser

- Make sure you're logged into [Scouts | Terrain](https://terrain.scouts.com.au/)
- Go to the [Programming page](https://terrain.scouts.com.au/programming)
- Click "Plan Activity"
- Set a basic title so the organiser knows what it's for, and get the date and times roughly correct. The organiser will fix these later.
- Make sure you just fill out anything else required, even if it's incorrect for now.
- Skip everything else, and click "Next Step".
- Select "Unit" under "Who is this activity for?" and add the organiser under "Who will organise this activity?". This allows them to edit the plan on their Terrain.
- Ignore everything else, keep clicking "Next" until you're back on the calendar page.
- Let the organiser know that they can edit their plan on Terrain.
