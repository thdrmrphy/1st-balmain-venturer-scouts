# Plan a night

This is the one comprehensive document you should need to help you plan a night for 1st Balmain Venturer Scouts.

When you're planning, you'll be talking to the Unit Council, specifically those responsible for Internal Communication and Coordination and Implementation. Check the [Unit Council List](../Unit%20Council.md) to see who's currently responsible. 

The Unit Council will take care of communication, consent forms, and payments for you, but you need to plan the night and provide the information, ensuring you've booked anything appropriately, worked out likely attendance numbers, etc.

## Starting to plan

Make sure that you know the date or potential dates for the night and any assistants before you begin. Let the Unit Council know so that they can set up Terrain for you to create a calendar event.

## Things to consider

When planning for your night, there are plenty of variables to consider. Some nights are large-scale off-site adventures; others may be quiet in-hall activities. Below should cover most situations but remember, just ask the Unit Council if you're unsure.

### Off-site Activities

**Consent**

If you're planning an off-site activity, then it's a Scouts policy and legal requirement that you create and distribute an E1 (Event 1) consent form for parents to give permission for their children to attend. This form must be accurate, comprehensive and give parents all the information they need. If a Venturer turns up but has not given consent, then, unfortunatley, they must be turned back unless consent can be verified at the time by an adult leader.

Fortunately, it's all online and the Unit Council does it for you. You do, however, need to make sure that the Unit Council is aware of the need for a consent form and that they distribute one at an appropriate time before the night. You'll write all the information for it via Terrain (see below).

**Transport**

Usually the transport method for travel to and from off-site activities is up to each Venturer, however, you may want to meet at the hall and catch a ferry, for example. Ensure this information is clear on Terrain so that the digital E1 is accurate.

**Meeting time**

Often with off-site activities, the meeting time is not the regular 7pm start. Make sure this is clear, and consider asking for Venturers to arrive early or allowing extra time before the expected start so you can stay as a group when off-site.

**Cost**

Some off-site activities will cost money. The Unit Council also takes care of this, so let them know the exact cost. If you're booking something, work out the expected cost per Venturer so you can be reimbursed appropriately. Parents will pay this money via 1st Balmain's treasury, except in some circumstances - such as buying tickets on the night - so check with the Unit Council if you're unsure.

**Risk Assessment**

From time to time, a night may require a risk assessment, and usually only when it's off-site. The Unit Council will tell you if there's sufficient risk for this to be required. Use the [Risk Assessment table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gknK1qSSEgFvH6_e0UxwhoRjaWYLMX5vc01zq_FyhT4/edit#gid=697180700) from Terrain, fill it out and submit (see below).

### On-site activities

**Consent**

On-site activities or those close to the hall (such as in the adjacent park) don't require consent. Rarely, however, for activities deemed "adventurous", this isn't the case, so check with the Unit Council and read above if you're unsure.

**Meeting time**

If you're running a night on-site, remember that Venturers will expect the start to be 7pm as usual. If this isn't the case, make sure it's clear so the Unit Council can communicate this information accurately.

**Cost**

Occasionally, on-site activites will cost money to run or supply. The Unit Council also takes care of this, so let them know the exact cost. If you're booking something, work out the expected cost per Venturer so you can be reimbursed appropriately. Parents will pay this money via 1st Balmain's treasury, except in some circumstances - such as buying tickets on the night - so check with the Unit Council if you're unsure.

### Other considerations

- If you're planning an activity with another group, ensure the Unit Council is involved in this communication so everything's clear with all involved.
- Venturers will be expected to wear their uniforms with scarves. If you believe this would be a problem or not required for your night, discuss with the Unit Council.
- Scouts policy says that if leaders are present, there must be at least two. The Unit Council will ensure this is the case, but just keep it in mind.

## Timeline

### When you're planning

Follow the above considerations and make sure you've worked out anything else you can think of. Ensure you've booked anything as required, confirmed attendance of other groups if planned and worked out clear details.

Now, it's time to fill out the Terrain entry for your night as fully as possible. See [this guide](/Terrain.md).

### Two weeks before the night

It's now time to fully brief the Unit Council on all the details of the night if you haven't already. This will likely just be directing them to Terrain to review what you've written.

If an E1 form is required, the Unit Council will create one based on the information on Terrain at this point. It will go to parents and parents will be reminded every few days until they complete the form (they can accept or reject).

### One week before the night

At this point, any final information should be confirmed, so that the Unit Council can communicate it to the Venturers.

### The day before

Log onto Terrain and double-check all the details are correct. If you've recently completed a Milestone, make sure it's been reviewed and approved on Terrain, otherwise the Lead will not count towards your next Milestone.

Verify with the Unit Council that everything will go ahead as planned.

### On the day

At roughly 9am, the Calendar bot will automatically send a reminder on Jandi to all the Venturers. Keep an eye out for any questions that Venturers may have.

By now, any Operoo responses should be returned, so the Unit Council will let you know of expected attendance. 

Finally, run your night and have fun!

## After the night has concluded

- Log onto Terrain and find your event on the Programming page.
- Under "Activities to be concluded" (below the calendar), click "Conclude activity" on the right.
- On the Attendance list, find "Rows per page:" and change to dropdown to "All".
- Tick the Attendance and Participation boxes next to each attendee's name. 
    - Attendance simply logs their presence for analytical purposes.
    - Participation attributes their particpation towards their Milestones.
- Click "Next Step"
- Fill out all required fields (with an asterisk). These are just part of the "Review>" process and don't affect programming.
- Click "Next Step"
- Finalise that everything on the page is correct, then click "Conclude Plan" at the bottom. 

Everyone has now been attributed appropriately for their Milestones and the event has been formally concluded :tada:
