## Region Gathering 2024 - Packing List
*This is a standing camp, so you don’t have to be restrictive with bag weight. You can bring those little extras, just not the kitchen sink.*
#### Sleeping

[ ] **Inflatable sleeping mat** - or yoga mat. No large thick inflatable air mattress, it has to fit in a tent.

[ ] **Sleeping bag** - remember to wrap in a well sealed garbage bag or dry bag to keep dry.  Bags can get wet and drink bottles can leak and it isn’t fun sleeping in a wet sleeping bag.

[ ] **Pillowslip** - that can be stuffed with clothes to make a pillow, or bring a pillow

[ ] **Sleeping bag inner** - can use old sheet sewn together. A good sleeping bag inner will protect the sleeping bag from getting dirty (these are a lot easier to clean than sleeping bag) and provide extra warmth

[ ] **Extra blanket** - if you have one, to keep you warm

[ ] **Hot water bottle** - if you would like

[ ] **Small 2-3 person tent** if you have one.  Unless you tell us we will assume we are bringing tents for you.
#### Clothing

[ ] **Scout uniform** - must be worn to and from camp

[ ] **Scout scarf** - must be worn to and from camp

[ ] **1-2 pairs closed in shoes**

[ ] **3 shirts** - preferably with a collar for sun protection - at least 2 should be long sleeved to keep you warm

[ ] **2 pairs warm long pants** (jeans not suitable on camp) or shorts

[ ] **Brimmed hat**

[ ] **Sleepwear** - PJs or thermals 

[ ] **Warm polar fleece or wool jumper** - no cotton hoodies (when wet these are cold and take a long time to dry and warm you)

[ ] **Thermal top and thermal leggings** - if you are too cold to sleep you will be miserable all weekend

[ ] **Beanie and gloves** - it gets quite cold at night

[ ] **Good raincoat** - this needs to be able to cut the wind and keep you dry. Plastic emergency type ponchos flap in the wind and don’t do as good a job as a good raincoat

[ ] **Undies and socks** - enough for 3 days (actually change them)
#### Eating

[ ] **Mess kit** in a cloth bag containing:
	
[ ] plate
	
[ ] bowl
	
[ ] cup or mug
	
[ ] knife
	
[ ] fork
	
[ ] spoon
	
[ ] tea towel
#### Hygiene
